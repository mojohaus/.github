// Canonical label set for the mojohaus organisation.
//
// Same set and colours as codehaus-plexus/.github/labels.js, which mirrors
// apache/maven-gh-actions-shared. Contributors move between the three orgs and
// should not have to learn three vocabularies.
//
// Applied by .github/workflows/label-sync.yml. The sync adds and corrects these
// labels; it never deletes others, because deleting a label strips it from every
// issue that carried it.
//
// Colour rule: no two labels share a colour, and any two that can appear side by
// side differ in text colour too.
